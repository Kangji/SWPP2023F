Generic single-database configuration.

```sh
# if you want to create new revision
$ alembic revision -m {version_name}

# if you want to autogenerate new revision based on env.py
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m {revision_name}

# if you want to start newest version
$ alembic upgrade head

# if you want to run specific version
$ alembic upgrade {revision_id}

# if you want to downgrade, you cannot use HEAD;
# instead, you can do downgrade following two ways.

# 1. downgrade with absolute revision_id
$ alembic downgrade {revision_id}

# 2. downgrade with relative location
$ alembic downgrade -1
```
